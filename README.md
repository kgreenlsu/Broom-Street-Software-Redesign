# Broom-Street-Software-Redesign
The reason why I decided to redo Broom Street Software's website was because I told the CIO of the company, Martin Cohen, that I would make his website look better than it did. He showed his website at an IT Workshop recently and I felt that since I was becoming familar with Bootstrap that I should take on the challenge of making his website since I told him I would come up with something more user friendly than what he is using now. I had never made a website for an actual buisness before so it was a nice change of pace. It was a learning experience, and it really helped me with figuring out what I wanted to do with my life.
